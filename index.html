        <h1>The Useless Function</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>So yeah, as the name implies, this is pretty much an useless function. It only makes the number itself longer to write with the function.</p>
        <p>For the functions with a subscript/superscript <b>n</b>, <b>n</b> MUST be a natural number bigger than 0.</p>
        <h2><u>Without index</u></h2>
        <p>For example: U(x) = x for all x.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A couple of examples <u>without index</u>: </p>
        <div id="examples">
            <p>U(1) = 1</p>
            <p>U(3) = 3</p>
            <p>U(1,581,392) = 1,581,392</p>
            <p>U(2<sup>2<sup>10</sup></sup>) = 2<sup>2<sup>10</sup></p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Yeah, see? SUPER useless. I am sincerely sorry.</p>
        <h2><u>With index</u></h2>
        <p>Actually, before you go, there is one more use to this function. If it has a subscript, it's <small>not</small> different. Let me explain.</p>
        <p>U<sub>n</sub>(x) = x</p>
        <p>See? It's so much different <small>no idiot, it's the same.</small>, if both the with and without index functions were placed side-by-side, I could differentiate them so well. <small>no you can't. except the fact that with index, it's even longer.</small></p>
        <p>A couple of examples <u>with index</u>:</p>
        <div id="examples">
            <p>U<sub>2</sub>(3) = 3</p>
            <p>U<sub>1,395</sub>(584) = 584</p>
            <p>U<sub>10<sup>100</sup></sub>(10<sup>3,003</sup>) = 10<sup>3,003</sup></p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Oh, wait. There is no difference. <small>finally, this idiot realised...</small> Oh well.</p>
        <h2><u>Nested useless functions</u></h2>
        <p>Ok ok, here is an actually different function. <small>no.</small></p>
        <p>U<sup>n</sup>(x) = U(U(U(U(...x)...)))) with n U's</p>
        <p>This is SO much more different, I swear! <small>ok this is getting obsolete.</small></p>
        <p>As always, a couple more examples with <u>nested useless functions</u>:</p>
        <div id="examples">
            <p>U<sup>3</sup>(4) = U(U(U(4))) = U(U(4)) = U(4) = 4</p>
            <p>U<sup>5</sup>(15) = U(U(U(U(U(15))))) = U(U(U(U(15)))) = U(U(U(15))) = U(U(15)) = U(15) = 15</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Jeez, I can't come up with anything new, can I? Well, I'll just leave it at this, I guess.</p>
        <br>

        <p><b>A stupid webpage made by a 13 year old idiot, Glazty. Yeah, ok I just said I would leave it at that. Haha, I lied. Also, sarcastic "haha" <small>wow</small>.</b></p>
